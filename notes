On automatically setting up render queue groups
	SceneNode::getChildIterator -> map<string, Node*>::iterator

	// | This will probably only return the immediately attached children
	// v so the scene will have to be recursed with SceneNode::getChildIterator

	SceneNode::getAttachedObjectIterator -> map<string, MovableObject*>::iterator
	MovableObject::setRenderQueueGroup
	// or if we're testing submeshes cast to Entity

	// Static geometry can have render queue group batch set
	SceneManager::createStaticGeometry
	StaticGeometry::(addEntity|addSceneNode)


Blender2Ogre appears to only export submeshes if they have a separate material
	It also appears to name the submeshes after their materials
